The mini-project of Noam and Achyia!
This project let's you simulate a program to control a public transport bus to save and control
your database of buses and lines all of the time.
It also let's you simulate a trip, a yellow sign like a real station and more!

The project comes with a data already that is saved in the Project/bin/xml folder.

Please rebuild the solution before the first use.
